Overview

This project is part of the research conducted under my Masterâ€™s Thesis for the MSc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence) at Dublin City University.
The research focuses on Automatic News Summarization using Transformer-based architectures (Pegasus) for abstractive summarization, complemented by extractive methods (graph-based and LSTM-Seq2Seq models).

Highlights

Fine-tuned Pegasus for summarizing real-world news datasets.

Combined extractive and abstractive techniques to enhance summary coherence.

Deployed the model as a cloud-based web app for real-time summarization.

Integrated evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU for model validation.
